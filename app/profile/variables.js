    bio: 'I am currently enrolled in the Unversity of Waterloo, Global Business \
    and Digital Arts. I am studying UX design, web design, and videography. I \
    have Japanese citizenship and Canadian PR status. I lived in Japan for \
    about half of my life, so I profoundly understand the Japanese language \
    and culture. Additionally, I have lived in Canada for about seven years, \
    so I speak native-level English; I scored 113 on the TOEFL iBT test.\
    I have experience working at a flower shop as an IT adviser and also at a \
    study abroad agency. I am currently working part-time as an online English \
    tutor. I have experience with most Adobe software, including Photoshop, \
    Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, and XD. Furthermore, I \
    am studying UX design and graphic design at university and studying web \
    development on my own. I am capable of web development using JavaScript \
    frameworks such as React.',
